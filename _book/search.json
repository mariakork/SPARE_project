You can open the link in the Microsoft Edge.\nTo use the experience builder in ArcGIS online, you need first to activate the swipe widget (down in the middle of the page), that provides the option to view layers next to each other or one layer in the left side and the grey basemap on the right side. The map has been organised based on the Naturregnskap (Økosystemregnskap). The categories includes Grunnkart, Areal, Tilstand-Biodiversitet, Tilstand and Økosystemtjeneste. All the layers are inactive, and you have to click on the eye sign to activate them. Next to layer tab is the legend of the map. Every time that you open one layer, the legend is on too. When you open a layer, you zoom, and you can click in one block and get information in a table appearing next to the block."

A step 2 road involves the detention of runoff from its area and its surroundings accommodating a service level corresponding to a precipitation event with a 5-year return period. This leads to the two following requirements for a step 2 road:\n\nMust retain precipitation hitting its road area\nMust retain excess water from upstream adjacent step 1 roads.\n\nThis also entails that a step 2 road is not allowed to have a spillover. The developed method for designating these roads incorporates a parameter classified on a scale of 1 to 4. The parameter is flexible and context-dependent. Due to the topographical conditions of Oslo and due to the assumption of there being an important coherence between the slope of a road and its ability to retain and delay runoff, it is found appropriate to base this parameter on the slope, when Oslo is the case area. In addition, the road capacity is used for the designation. For roads to meet the requirements for step 2 roads, their capacity must be increased, i.e., the depth must be adjusted to a value higher than the size of the corresponding precipitation event with a 5-year return period. Otherwise, the step 2 road would only be able to fulfill requirement 1. Based on similar climate adaptation projects on roads in Copenhagen, the depth of the designated step 2 roads is set to 0.40 m (Jensen, 2023). The depth should again solely be seen as a necessary measure to calculate the capacity of the roads and illustrate the principle behind the developed method.” So, the maps show which roads can be recommended as step 1 and step 2 using the assumption that those two types of roads jointly should be able to manage a 20 mm rain event without overflow to lower-lying areas, and with a maximum storage depth of 40 cm on step 2 streets.\nArealregnskap-Økosystemtype (by NIBIO, 2024)\nIt shows the ecosystem type\nBymorfologiklassifisering for blokker (by NINA, 2022)\nIt shows the urban morphology of the\nBefolkningsetthet per grunnkretser (by NINA, 2022)\nIt shows the population density per grunnkretser.
