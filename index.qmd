## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This work is part of the SPARE project that aims to provide knowledge, evidence-based management approaches and tools to
better integrate climate change adaptation (with a focus on stormwater management), biodiversity support and
recreation in urban land-use management by using BGI to enable SPARE-management and facilitate the
transition to blue-green cities.
